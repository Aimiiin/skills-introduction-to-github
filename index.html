I just earned my "Introduction to Git" badge! Proud to mark this milestone and excited to keep building my skills.learning how to manage code, track changes, and collaborate efficiently using Git. From understanding commits and branches to navigating merge conflicts and version control workflows, it's been a valuable hands-on experience.
